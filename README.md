## Image Storage üì∏

This application uses **Cloudinary** for efficient and scalable image storage. Here's how the image handling works:

1. **Image Upload**  
   When a user uploads an image, it is directly stored in Cloudinary. This ensures high availability and optimized delivery of images.

2. **Backend Storage**  
   Only the **image link (URL)** returned by Cloudinary is stored in the backend database (MongoDB). This minimizes the size of the database and improves performance.

### Why Cloudinary?  
- **Performance**: Optimized delivery of images via a global Content Delivery Network (CDN).  
- **Storage Efficiency**: Reduces the need for storing large files in the database.  
- **Scalability**: Easily handles a growing number of images as the application scales.  
- **Transformation**: Provides options to resize, crop, and apply transformations to images on the fly.

### Example Workflow  
1. A user uploads an image via the frontend.  
2. The image is sent to Cloudinary using the **API key and secret**.  
3. Cloudinary returns a URL for the stored image.  
4. This URL is saved in MongoDB for later retrieval.
